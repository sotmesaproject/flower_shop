HowTo: Add Jobs To cron Under Linux or UNIX?

How do I add cron job under Linux or UNIX like operating system?

Cron allows Linux and Unix users to run commands or scripts at a given date and time. You can schedule scripts to be executed periodically. Cron is one of the most useful tool in a Linux or UNIX like operating systems. It is usually used for sysadmin jobs such as backups or cleaning /tmp/ directories and more. The cron service (daemon) runs in the background and constantly checks the /etc/crontab file, and /etc/cron.*/ directories. It also checks the /var/spool/cron/ directory.

crontab command

You need to use the crontab command to edit/create, install, deinstall or list the cron jobs in Vixie Cron. Each user can have their own crontab file, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. You need to use crontab command for editing or setting up your own cron jobs.
Types of cron configuration files

There are different types of configuration files:

    The UNIX / Linux system crontab : Usually, used by system services and critical jobs that requires root like privileges. The sixth field (see below for field description) is the name of a user for the command to run as. This gives the system crontab the ability to run commands as any user.
    The user crontabs: User can install their own cron jobs using the crontab command. The sixth field is the command to run, and all commands run as the user who created the crontab

Note: This faq features cron implementations written by Paul Vixie and included in many Linux distributions and Unix like systems such as in the popular 4th BSD edition. The syntax is compatible with various implementations of crond.
How Do I install or create or edit my own cron jobs?

To edit or create your own crontab file, type the following command at the UNIX / Linux shell prompt:
$ crontab -e
Do I have to restart cron after changing the crontable file?

No. Cron will examine the modification time on all crontabs and reload those which have changed. Thus cron need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.
Syntax of crontab (field description)

The syntax is:

 
1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/command arg1 arg2
 

OR

 
1 2 3 4 5 /root/backup.sh
 

Where,

    1: Minute (0-59)
    2: Hours (0-23)
    3: Day (0-31)
    4: Month (0-12 [12 == December])
    5: Day of the week(0-7 [7 or 0 == sunday])
    /path/to/command - Script or command name to schedule

Easy to remember format:

* * * * * command to be executed
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)

Your cron job looks as follows for system jobs:

1 2 3 4 5 USERNAME /path/to/command arg1 arg2

OR

1 2 3 4 5 USERNAME /path/to/script.sh

Example: Run backup cron job script

If you wished to have a script named /root/backup.sh run every day at 3am, your crontab entry would look like as follows. First, install your cronjob by running the following command:
# crontab -e

Append the following entry:
0 3 * * * /root/backup.sh

Save and close the file.
More examples

To run /path/to/command five minutes after midnight, every day, enter:
5 0 * * * /path/to/command

Run /path/to/script.sh at 2:15pm on the first of every month, enter:
15 14 1 * * /path/to/script.sh

Run /scripts/phpscript.php at 10 pm on weekdays, enter:
0 22 * * 1-5 /scripts/phpscript.php

Run /root/scripts/perl/perlscript.pl at 23 minutes after midnight, 2am, 4am ..., everyday, enter:
23 0-23/2 * * * /root/scripts/perl/perlscript.pl

Run /path/to/unixcommand at 5 after 4 every Sunday, enter:
5 4 * * sun /path/to/unixcommand
How do I use operators?

An operator allows you to specifying multiple values in a field. There are three operators:

    The asterisk (*) : This operator specifies all possible values for a field. For example, an asterisk in the hour time field would be equivalent to every hour or an asterisk in the month field would be equivalent to every month.
    The comma (,) : This operator specifies a list of values, for example: "1,5,10,15,20, 25".
    The dash (-) : This operator specifies a range of values, for example: "5-15" days , which is equivalent to typing "5,6,7,8,9,....,13,14,15" using the comma operator.
    The separator (/) : This operator specifies a step value, for example: "0-23/" can be used in the hours field to specify command execution every other hour. Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say every two hours, just use */2.

How do I disable email output?

By default the output of a command or a script (if any produced), will be email to your local email account. To stop receiving email output from crontab you need to append >/dev/null 2>&1. For example:
0 3 * * * /root/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

To mail output to particular email account let us say vivek@nixcraft.in you need to define MAILTO variable as follows:
MAILTO="vivek@nixcraft.in"
0 3 * * * /root/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

See "Disable The Mail Alert By Crontab Command" for more information.
Task: List all your cron jobs

Type the following command:
# crontab -l
# crontab -u username -l

To remove or erase all crontab jobs use the following command:
# Delete the current cron jobs #
crontab -r

## Delete job for specific user. Must be run as root user ##
crontab -r -u username
Use special string to save time

Instead of the first five fields, you can use any one of eight special strings. It will not just save your time but it will improve readability.
Special string	Meaning
@reboot	Run once, at startup.
@yearly	Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
@annually	(same as @yearly)
@monthly	Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
@weekly	Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
@daily	Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
@midnight	(same as @daily)
@hourly	Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".
Examples

Run ntpdate command every hour:
@hourly /path/to/ntpdate

Make a backup everyday:
@daily /path/to/backup/script.sh
More about /etc/crontab file and /etc/cron.d/* directories

/etc/crontab is system crontabs file. Usually only used by root user or daemons to configure system wide jobs. All individual user must must use crontab command to install and edit their jobs as described above. /var/spool/cron/ or /var/cron/tabs/ is directory for personal user crontab files. It must be backup with users home directory.
Understanding Default /etc/crontab

Typical /etc/crontab file entries:

SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/
# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

First, the environment must be defined. If the shell line is omitted, cron will use the default, which is sh. If the PATH variable is omitted, no default will be used and file locations will need to be absolute. If HOME is omitted, cron will use the invoking users home directory.

Additionally, cron reads the files in /etc/cron.d/ directory. Usually system daemon such as sa-update or sysstat places their cronjob here. As a root user or superuser you can use following directories to configure cron jobs. You can directly drop your scripts here. The run-parts command run scripts or programs in a directory via /etc/crontab file:
Directory	Description
/etc/cron.d/	Put all scripts here and call them from /etc/crontab file.
/etc/cron.daily/	Run all scripts once a day
/etc/cron.hourly/	Run all scripts once an hour
/etc/cron.monthly/	Run all scripts once a month
/etc/cron.weekly/	Run all scripts once a week
How do I use above directories to put my own scripts or jobs?

Here is a sample shell script called clean.cache. This script is created to clean up cached files every 10 days. This script is directly created at /etc/cron.daliy/ directory. In other words create a text file called /etc/cron.daily/clean.cache as follows.

 #!/bin/bash
# A sample shell script to clean cached file from lighttpd web server
CROOT="/tmp/cachelighttpd/"
 
# Clean files every $DAYS
DAYS=10
 
# Web server username and group name
LUSER="lighttpd"
LGROUP="lighttpd"
 
# Okay, let us start cleaning as per $DAYS
/usr/bin/find ${CROOT} -type f -mtime +${DAYS} | xargs -r /bin/rm
 
# Failsafe 
# if directory deleted by some other script just get it back 
if [ ! -d $CROOT ]
then
        /bin/mkdir -p $CROOT
        /bin/chown ${LUSER}:${LGROUP} ${CROOT}
fi

Save and close the file. Set the permissions:
# chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/clean.cache
How do I backup installed cron jobs entries?

Simply type the following command to backup your cronjobs to a nas server mounted at /nas01/backup/cron/users.root.bakup directory:
# crontab -l > /nas01/backup/cron/users.root.bakup
# crontab -u userName -l > /nas01/backup/cron/users.userName.bakup

                Think you need to put:
                0,15,30,45 * * * * /path/to/script.php

                if you want it to execute every 15 minutes.

    Using Puppy Linux at the moment. How does one check to see if the cron daemon is running.?
    I have a file that works from the command line.
    “/home/dwj/CRONY/cronf.01” which simply makes a statement on the monitor screen. I want cron to be able to put a variety of messages on the monitor screen at various times through the day & week. [ A separate file for each message of course.]
    But so far nothing I had tried works. In /var/spool/cron/crontabs/dwj [ my crontab file which was created using Puppy’s GUI ‘gcrontab’ within their control panel, bottom selection.].
    The items in the fields look correct to me vis:
    “01-59/6 * * * * /home/dwj/CRON/cronf.01”

    Which is supposed to mean from minute 01-59 each
    6 second interval = do the file in field #-6.
    What else am I missing or do not understand.?

    TIA for any & all help rendered.

        david u know cron job wakes up each and every minute….so u can’t
        write a cron script which is supposed to run each and every second.
        for that u have to write a script and another one u can schedule a particular job
        like 7:30:45.
        for dis u have to write a script at 7:30 first.give this script name to a.sh.then….
        in unix there s a concept called wrapper script in which u will include the “sleep”
        command
        write another script called b.sh
        in there write
        sleep 44 a.sh
        then execute it. it will run at 7:30:45

    David,

    Crontab is designed to work with minutes and upwards it cannot wake up and run task every second or every 6 second later. cron is not really
    designed for such frequent runs.

    You need to start your script in background
    /home/dwj/CRON/cronf.01 &

    in script put logic as follows
    while [ true ]; do
    sleep 6
    # add rest of commands
    Done

    The response to “how to run every 15 minutes” is wrong. The answer given:

    15 * * * * /path/to/script.sh

    will run the thing every hour, at the 15 minute mark. (9:15, 10:15, etc)

    The proper answer is:

    0,15,30 * * * * script.sh

    or

    0-59/15 * * * * script.sh

    (depends on your version of cron)

    Aravind,

    You need to write a smart script that will detect First Saturday of Every Month as you can not write such cron job. You can also try following trick:
    00 01 1-7 1-12 * if [ "$(date +%a) = "Sat" ]; then /path/to/script.sh; fi

    Add additional logic in /path/to/script.sh to detect First Sat of each month.

    Lakshmi Shastry April 26, 2007, 7:44 am

    I need to write a cron expression which fires every 5 hours from the given start time. Ex:- If 8.30 am is my start time then the cron expression will be something like “30 8,0-23/5 * * *”. But this fires in the time sequence like at 8.30, 10.30, 15.30, 20.30, 00.30, 10.30 etc…
    But what i need the time sequence is 8.30, 13.30, 18.30, 1.30, 6.30, 11.30, 16.30, 21.30, 2.30… which means that fire should occur for the specified start time and every 5 hours after that. Can anyone help me with the cron expression to represent the same. Thanks a lot in advance.

        hey lakshmi ..
        firstly you check this command “crontab -l Display your crontab file.” that show you presentally crontab.After that see your chron scrip ki chang or not .there is some two hours interval . You want run this scrip in all day of week. Then in this case you use this script.. “30 8:30,13:30,18:30,1:30,6:30,11:30,16:30,21:30,2:30 * * # give your destinestion path#

        and other wire u check the chmod permision if this script solve your problem .so plz reply

    When i try to run crontab i get the following error message “failed user root parsing”.

    And the cron is not executing anything.

    The command crontab -l indicates that everything is fine and that i have scheduled a command correctly.

    Also checked that the service is running “crond”

    cant get cron to work please help!

    I am using Puppy linux 2.16

    Thanks for help, my email is: Johan@mediavisiongroup.se

    Hi,
    My cron manage to execute at the desired time but the email i received is “permission denied”. I copy and paste the message below

    “/bin/sh: /usr/bin/lynx: Permission denied”

    The cron command is as follows :-

    lynx -dump http://myurl.com/cgi-bin/autoresponder/activate.cgi

    What it does is to log in toe activate.cgi at certain time of the day. By typing the url manually will require a password first and the command is executed.

    Is this the problem that cause the permission denied ? If this is the case – how can i incorporate the password in the cron command line ?

    Hope you can assist.
    Thanks.

        it means at 1:30 morning, the clean_parse_logs.sh script starts running everday automatically and creates a clean_parse_logs in “/home/logs/” and then adds the information status of runing script “clean_parse_logs.sh” into the file “clean_parse_logs.log”.

    Use fcron; which doesn’t wake up every minute to see whether there is a job to be executed. It sees the next time when to wake up and wakes up at the particular time only unless a user edited his fcrontab to wake it up before. It saves resources. The syntax is quite similar but there is some difference which can be learnt by using.

    http://fcron.free.fr

    it is available in fedora’s repos.

    how do i append new task or crontab job using scprite in existing task
    Reply Link
    Rajitha May 13, 2008, 6:52 am

    submitting the job in crontab is a bit confusing for the beginners.

    in a text file(eg., file.txt) give all the cron jobs you want to schedule
    eg., 15 14 * * * /root/dir/script.sh

    and submit the file using crontab
    crontab file.txt

    in order to do this user need to have permisson, which can be seen using cron.allow file

    if the crontab file is already existing use crontab -e to add ur job to the crontab.
    if it is already existing crontab -l displays the existing jobs

    one imp thing to remember is you need to provide all absolute paths in the script which u want to schedule, otherwise u will end up in thinking why my cron job is not running though it is added properly.

    Is the eight special string suitable use for all type/version of linux operating system? (eg.Red-hat, Ubuntu)

    Example:
    Special string Meaning
    @reboot Run once, at startup.
    @yearly Run once a year, “0 0 1 1 *”.
    @annually (same as @yearly)
    @monthly Run once a month, “0 0 1 * *”.
    @weekly Run once a week, “0 0 * * 0”.
    @daily Run once a day, “0 0 * * *”.

    Hi, I´ve just made my script and put it into crontab…
    I want my script to run this command ( opensipsctl fifo lb_resize 1 pstn 0) if ping fails.
    It looks like this…

    #!/bin/bash
    # add ip / hostname separated by while space
    HOSTS="192.168.0.11"
    # no ping request
    COUNT=1
     for myHost in $HOSTS
    do
      count=$(ping -c $COUNT $myHost | grep 'received' | awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' | awk '{ print $1 }')
      if [ $count -eq 0 ]; then
        # 100% failed
        opensipsctl fifo lb_resize 1 pstn 0
      fi
    done

    If I run the script from the command line it works nice and smooth, but if it runs from the CRON it doesn´t work

    I have this on my crontab so it will run every minute

    0-59 0-23 * * * /etc/opensips/monitor_server1.sh

    If I look at my LOG, my CRON call it
    Apr 21 21:25:01 [cron] (root) CMD (/etc/opensips/monitor_server1.sh )

    But it doesn´t work…

    Any idea?

    I have a cron job with multiple jobs listed at various times throughout the day.

    I have two questions:

    1) For each job, is it possible to reset the MAILTO statement to a different user? (E.g., Cathy is a user for a cron job that runs at 11:30 PM every day, her cron job is:
    30 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/sas -noterminal /users/adrc/cathy/imaging/makedata.sas &
    Scot is a user of a cron job that runs at 2:39 AM every day, his cron job is:
    13 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/sas -noterminal -sysin /users/adrc/scot/sas_program
    s/batch_scripts/hpdabat.sas & )
    So is it possible to set a MAILTO= Cathy@domain.com prior to her cron job and then set another MAILTO=Scot@domain.com for his cron job?

    2)While my cron jobs work, I have been receiving the following failed message:
    /bin/sh:
    : command not found

    Any ideas what could be causing this?

    Thanks for your time.
    Reply Link
        nixCraft June 16, 2009, 3:16 pm

        1) For each MAILTO add cronjob to users account and not to root users account. Run:

        crontab -e -u cathy

        2) /bin/sh is not installed hence you see the error. A

    Thank you, Vivek.

    I now have the Mailto working.

    However, now instead of the fail message “: command not found”, I get a null fail message. Basically, it’s just an email stating the cron job failed, but nothing in the message. Just blank.

    I appreciate any help in correcting this.

    MsfStl June 22, 2009, 3:15 pm

    Thanks again Vivek. I believe I found out what was going on. I had the following job scheduled:

    17 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/sas -noterminal -sysin /users/adrc/scot/sas_programs/batch_scripts/hpdabat.sas 2>&1 | mail -s “RE: Scot HPDA Cron Fail” scot@xxxxxx.edu

    What was happening (and this is where my inexperience comes in) is that the code “2>&1 | mail – s….” was set to send an email everytime the job ran with the subject line ” RE: Scot HPDA Cron Fail”. I was piping that to run everytime (I thought it would only send if it failed.) The “2>&1” code basically states that the email include a standard error message, if there is one, along with any other message. Since there was no error message the code did what I told it to and sent me an email called “RE:Scot HPDA Cron Fail” with nothing in it. The job works as it should. I have decided to remove the mail code and just let it do it’s thing.

    Thanks again,

    Scot

    i used putty to copy the file from one of the directories in the system to the /etc/cron.daily directory….
    Would some permissions be causing it to not execute it.

    I am new to CRON command. What I want is to have a CRON job execute myWeb Service which takes two parameters. Maybe I should use a .sh file instead of the whole URL with parameters in the command line. Can someone give me a simple sample, thank you.

    1. Immediately after installing a new server one of the things you should do is document exactly what files are suid. As part of your job monitoring a server you will periodically look at what files on the server are suid. A file suddenly becoming suid when it was not originally is a sign that your server has been compromised. What UNIX command will list all files that are suid on the server? What UNIX command will list all files that are sgid on the server?

    2. Write a bash script which could be scheduled in cron to run nightly. The script would execute the two UNIX commands from step 1 above. If there is a difference between the original file (listing the suid files on the server) that you created when you installed the server and the file generated when you ran the cron job then you must email the administrator with the details of the differences. If the suid files on the server have not changed, do nothing.

    Can someone Please help me solve the above two task. I kindly appreciate.
    Thank You

    How to set the cron job that runs every week on sunday 10 am.
    10 * * * 1/path/to/command
    Is the above one correct.Please guide me.
    Reply Link
        gese74 October 5, 2010, 5:04 pm

        Hello Gaurab,

        From your command
        10 = tenth minute
        * = every hour
        * = every day
        * = Every month
        1 = Monday
        So since you have Monday it automatically nullifies the every day.

        So for your request the best should be
        00 10 * * 0 or 7

        I hope this helps

        Yes, place your script in /etc/cron.daily/ so that it will get run once a day. If you need to run the script, say at particular time (6 pm everyday), than add it to user crontab.

    i have a script ‘awstats-mrcomptech.com’ in the /etc/cron.hourly with the permissions 744, it is owned by root/root but it is not running, It did run at one time, so I must have inadvertently changed something, but I can’t see what I did to cause this hourly cron jobs to not run!

    how are the hourly cron jobs in ‘/etc/cron.hourly’ triggered to run?

    I can manually run the script with ‘/etc/cron.hourly/awstats-mrcomptech.com’ and it executes just fine.

    This is causing a problem that if I am not available to manually run the script at least once per day then the awstats for that day show 0 visits even though the apache log file show over a hundred visits.

        MrCompTech August 5, 2011, 2:49 pm

        It will run whatever is in the PHP script named ‘cron.php’. Since it’s named ‘cron’ and is associated with a domain and I’m assuming that the ‘domain’ is website, this script will probably doing something such as running an autoresponder, making a backup of the website or backing up the MySQL database for the website.

        Without the script it is impossible to provide specific details.

        If you would like more detailed information about this script you can send me a copy using the form on my website at http://mrcomptech.com/index.php/ask-a-technology-question.

    And I dont know how to configure the cron job code.

    Using the code, PATH-TO-PHP -q FULL-LOCAL-PATH-TO-DOMAIN/cron.php

    Where PATH-TO-PHP is the local path on your server to php and FULL-LOCAL-PATH-TO-DOMAIN is the full local path on your server to where you have the script installed.

    so, using my site…. what will i put to replace PATH-TO-PHP and FULL-LOCAL-PATH-TO-DOMAIN

        MrCompTech August 5, 2011, 4:37 pm

        Hi Lexyz,

        The instructions you received for using the script are generic. They have to be because the programmer cannot know on what server OS (Windows/Linux) or what version of the OS you will be putting the script on.

        Are you using purchased web hosting services for your website? If so then depending on your hosting provider you maybe able to use your cPanel to add the cron job. Most hosting providers also include ‘How-To’ video tutorials for their customers. These are usually located near the top of the cPanel.

        If the video tutorials are not sufficient then most likely you will have to contact your web hosting provider.

        If you host your own server or have purchased a VPS (Virtual Private Server) then I may be able to help you more. For example PHP is usually installed in ‘/usr/bin/php’. On your own server or VPS you must have root access to setup this cron job. But if it’s not your server then you most likely do not have ‘root’ access and that is why you would need to get instructions from your hosting provider on how they have configured their servers and whether or not they allow you to add a cron job.

        If I were adding this to one of my hosted web sites I would try to use the ‘Cron Jobs’ module in the cPanel to add the command to the list of commands as:

        php -q /publichtml/cron.php

        This may or may not work. My hosting provider does not provide a video on How-To setup a cron job so if this didn’t work I would have to contact my hosting provider for instructions.

        On my own server for my website http;//mrcomptech.com and assuming the file cron.php were in the root of my website and assuming I wanted this command to run once every hour..

        In the directory /etc/cron.hourly/

        I would create the file named ‘mysite.com.cron.php’ (the name is arbitrary)
        and this file would contain these 3 lines:

        #!/bin/bash
        /usr/bin/php /var/www/clients/client1/web1/web/cron.php > /dev/null
        exit 0

        Note there is a space after ‘/usr/bin/php’.
        The file permission would need to be 744 so that the system can execute it.
        To test that it worked, at the command prompt, I would run the command

        /usr/bin/php /var/www/clients/client1/web1/web/cron.php

        and then check to see that what it was supposed to do, it did. The script ‘cron.php’ is not a standard script, it is not something that is part of every website. So I can’t tell you specifically what your script is supposed to do without the script and any other scripts to which it it refers.

        Have A Nice Day! (HAND!)

    This should run at 22:00 (0 22) but only if it one of the first seven (1-7) days of months Mar, Jun, Sept, Dec (3,6,9,12) and then only if it is a Saturday (6).

    Awesome article. Love your site, I always get excited to see this.

    I *think* there might be a typo for sending emails to a custom address:
    MAILTO=”vivek@nixcraft.in”
    0 3 * * * /root/backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 (“2>&1” seems to disable email).

    I’m not 100% sure on that, but I couldn’t get emails delivered until I removed 2>&1.

    Finally a blog with some insight into cron jobs. I have a question about the email issues. I have a dedicated server (just learning how to manage) for my websites and host a few of my friends sites on it also. One of them has a cron job set using cPanel and it reads:
    curl -A “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6” -s http://www.hissite.com/billing/coin_cron/invoices.php

    However the emails get sent to my server address and not his domain address. I went into /etc/crontabs but if I change it to his address then all future cronjobs that I wanted to create would go there also, correct? Not what I want. How do I change it so he and any future clients emails will be sent to their domain? Sorry if this is confusing as I am just learning. Thanks in advance.

        1 * * * * /timestamp/home/user/Documents

        1st place = Minutes
        2nd place= Hours
        3rd place= Days
        4th place= Months
        5th place = Day of the Week

            It should be: */1 * * * * /timestamp/home/user/Documents
            as if you only do: 1 * * * * /timestamp/home/user/Documents it will do it the first minute of everyhour and not everyminute of the hour

    I was unable to run this command:

    You also need to enable crond service via sys v / BSD init style system. Under RHEL / CentOS / Fedora, you need to use chkconfig (ntsysv) command to enable crond on boot:
    # chekconfg crond on

    I see you had a typo there, as well. I’m using Lubuntu and it sees no candidate for chkconfig

        Hi,

        I am not too sure about cron jobs, but there are number of Freeware tools out there (such as NagiOS), which you can configure to do the monitoring of the hosts and send out alert notifications based on required conditions.

    I wish to run this following command on my Linux prompt every hour:

    /etc/init.d/symphoniad restart WebClient

    I have a text file with this command and saved into the /etc/cron.hourly folder with name restartwebclient. Will this command get executed every hour? If yes, how do i verify it and if no, how do i get to execute this command line every one hour.

    Kindly advise.

        Check crond log in your /var/log/ directory. On a CentOS/RHEL/Fedora Linux log file name – /var/log/cron.

    Just got bit by this myself. My oipinon is that it’s not suitable for production systems to automatically do this. At least put a question to the user if they want this turned on.My main database runs on an Areca hardware card that autoscrubs a 16 disk RAID-10 but doesn’t get in the way. I have several replicant slaves that have just a pair of 1TB 7200RPM SATA drives because they are read only and don’t need massive performance on IO. They work just fine. Until the first sunday of the month. I don’t care about bit rot, the data is all reproduceable from the master anytime I need it. I can monitor the drives with smart and replace them as needed easily and cheaply.However, a batch job that takes 6 hours ran for 12 hours last night and every customer I had was bitching about how slow the system was. In general there’s a lot of smart stuff done with mdadm. This is NOT one of them. Scott Marlowe

    Hi al. Most interesting. I have 3 inkjet printers with CISS. And I have Mepis Linux (KDE). As I’m going away for a month I would like to print a file called ‘test-page’ on each printer once a week to keep the print heads nice. Is it possible to start my computer with a script and perform this? (I would have to set wake up permissions in the BIOS I think) . What would the script look like . I am total newbie to bash and cron etc. Many thanks in advance for any help/script/instructions you email me.

        15 13 1/2 * * /path/to/script

        This will run 13:15 (1:15pm) every 2 days starting the 1st every month.
        Using 1/2 means:

        1= first run, first day of the month
        / = run every…
        2 = days (and then where you put it, in my example, it’s every 2 days)
        If i put it in hours it would be:

        15 13/2 * * * /path/to/script

        13 = hour to start
        / = every
        2 = hours
        and it would run: 13:15, 15:15, 17:15, 19:15, 21:15, 23:15

        you can also specify with commas and hyphens, eg:

        15 13 2,4,6,8,11,14,16-18, 22 * * /path/to/script
        This is only recommended if you want to run it irregularly, if you run the job regularly every X hours or X days, then use /X

        This would run the job 13:15 every month at these days of the month: 2 4 6 8 11 14 16 17 18 22

        When running jobs in crontab you don’t have any paths, e.g. /bin:/usr/bin and so on, so the executable you’re trying to run, lsof and wc, and probably even echo doesn’t work. You either have to set the path or use full path in the script, eg.
        if (( $(/usr/bin/lsof -i:3007 | /usr/bin/wc -l) > 0 ))

        I’m not sure where those files are on your system, but that’s what you need to do. And personally, I would use /full/path/to/script and in the script if you need to enter a dir do cd /path/to/dir
